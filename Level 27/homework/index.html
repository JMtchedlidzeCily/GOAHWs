        <h1>About Me and GOA</h1>
        <p>My name is Jarji. I joined GOA because my friend Ioane Tsertsvadze invited <br> me while we were in school. He told me everything about GOA and I loved it, <br> as I already had some expirience with pascal, I immideately told my mother about <br> GOA, she seemed to like it too so she let me join! I joined at speed(2) but then transferred to speed(3) <br> so I could learn faster.</p>
        <p>I'm from group 34.</p>
